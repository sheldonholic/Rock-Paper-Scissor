# Rock-Paper-Scissor Bot
A fun game .. maybe the INTERNATIONAL TIME PASS 😜

## Functionalities
- It takes the users choice and simultaneously generates a Bot's choice. 
- The winner is found among the two and then the game proceeds by given the respective points to either of the two. 
- The draw condition does not add to anyone's credits.

## Game play
On the count of three (usually accompanied by a chant of “Rock, Paper, Scissors”), each time raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down on the count, opposing players “throw” their selection into the middle. Rock is designated by maintaining the fist, Scissors by extending the middle and index fingers, and Paper by holding the hand out flat. If players throw out the same gesture, the game goes on. If not, it’s decided by a harmonic and intransitive method — rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, but paper covers rock.

## Inspiration
As small as it looks .. it's super fun to automate it using code. Starting small and trying to learn things from basics and then gradually advancing to the better versions was the motive behind choosing this topic.

## Challenges we ran into
For a beginner everything seemed a challenge to be honest.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The first time I read the documentation of JavaScript carefully and understood it.

## What's next for Rock-Paper-Scissor Bot
I'll try to add an animated object beside to give expressions as the game proceeds and make the overall experience more fun.
